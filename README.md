# Counterfactual Definiteness With No Interaction Risk
50% of the cases: no output and no interaction, 25% of the cases: we know that computer (the qubit q[2]) run without interacting, yet other 25% of the cases: we know that computer was off without interacting.

This interaction-free measurement is scalable by manifold repetition of the circuit, thereby measuring the qubit (in this specific case, q[2]) interaction-freely with the probability of 50% on each repetition, regardless of the qubit's eigenstate (|0⟩ or |1⟩). This circuit preserves some abilities of traditional ways of counterfactual quantum computation: the overall probability of measuring the qubit interaction-freely can be made arbitrarily close to 1. But the point is, this version of performing a counterfactual computation has no risk of interaction at all (instead of a probability that is arbitrarily close to 0).
