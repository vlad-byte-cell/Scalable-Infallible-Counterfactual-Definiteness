# Scalable-Infallible-Counterfactual-Definiteness
50% of the cases: no output, 25% of the cases: we know that computer run "for free" (without interacting), yet other 25% of the cases: we know that computer was off "for free."

This type of interaction-free measurement can be scaled by manifold repetition of the circuit, thereby measuring the qubit (in this specific case, q[2]) interaction-freely with the probability that is arbitrarily close to 1. On each repetition, the circuit has the 50% chance of measuring the qubit "for free," regardless of the qubit's eigenstate (|0⟩ or |1⟩). However, this version of performing a counterfactual computation never outputs false positives and false negatives.
